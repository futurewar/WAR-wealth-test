            <h5>UNDERSTANDING THE GOALS OF THE CLIENT</h5>
            <p>We have always believed that the true measure of wealth lies not in the numbers, but in what those numbers can do for you. 
               One of our key differentiators is our ability to truly understand what is most meaningful to our clients and their families. They 
               may have multiple, sometimes conflicting goals, requiring a strategy tailored to meeting each one.</p>
            <p>• Current - Lifestyle goals</p>
            <p>• Future - Lifestyle goals</p>
            <p>• Lifetime  - Goals</p>
            <p>• Legacy - Goals</p>
            <p>These goal categories form the foundation of the Wealth Framework outlined in more detail on the following pages.

                <h5>OUR APPROACH</h5>
                <p>As referenced in our five beliefs, our approach to wealth management and financial planning starts with the end 
                    goal in mind. Bearing in mind our clients’ current realities, we partner with them in defining their aspirations – 
                    the ambitions and goals they have for their lives.</p>
